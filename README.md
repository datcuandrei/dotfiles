```brew
koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
cmacrae/formulae/spacebar
```

to start the configs:
```zsh
skhd --start-service # or brew services start skhd
yabai --start-service # or brew services start yabai
brew start start spacebar
```

dotfiles location : `~`
<br>NOTE: the rc's `.yabairc` and `.spacebarrc` are executables.
<br>NOTE: `Nord.terminal` is for `Terminal.app`, only difference from the original theme being that it has a different font from the original one.
