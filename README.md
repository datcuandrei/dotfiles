# datcuandrei's dotfiles

In this repository, you will find dotfiles for my two configs: `osx` and `linux`

osx
---
```brew
koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
cmacrae/formulae/spacebar
```

to start the configs:
```zsh
skhd --start-service # or brew services start skhd
yabai --start-service # or brew services start yabai
brew start start spacebar
```

dotfiles location : `~`
NOTE: the rc's `.yabairc` and `.spacebarrc` are executables.
NOTE: `Nord.terminal` is for `Terminal.app`, only difference from the original theme being that it has a different font from the original one.
